# Fizzy

## Setting up for development

First get everything installed and configured with:

    bin/setup

If you'd like to load fixtures:

    bin/rails db:fixtures:load

And then run the development server:

    bin/dev

You'll be able to access the app in development at http://development-tenant.fizzy.localhost:3006

### Tests

For testing OpenAI API requests, we use [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr). If you want to test AI features exercising the API, you need to place the `config/credentials/test.key`
that you can get from 1Password in "Fizzy - test.key". Then, when running tests that use Open AI API, you must either set the env variable VCR_RECORD=1
or to add `vcr_record!` to the test. See `VcrTestHelper`.

## Running tests

For fast feedback loops, unit tests can be run with:

    bin/rails test

The full continuous integration tests can be run with:

    bin/ci

## Working with AI features

To work on AI features you need the OpenAI API key stored in the development's credentials file. To decrypt the credentials,
you need place the key in a file `config/credentials/development.key`. You can copy the file from One Password in
"Fizzy - development.key".

To get semantic searches working for existing data you need to calculate all the vector embeds:

```ruby
Card.find_each(&:refresh_search_embedding)
Comment.find_each(&:refresh_search_embedding)
```

## Deploying

Fizzy is deployed with Kamal. You'll need to have the 1Password CLI set up in order to access the secrets that are used when deploying. Provided you have that, it should be as simple as `bin/kamal deploy` to the correct environment.
